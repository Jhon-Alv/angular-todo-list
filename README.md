# Angular Todo List Application

A simple and clean Todo List application built with Angular that demonstrates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. This project connects to a REST API to manage tasks, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.

-----

## Features

  - **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks:** Easily manage your to-do items.
  - **Modern UI:** A clean and intuitive interface for a great user experience.
  - **HTTP Client:** Utilizes Angular's `HttpClient` module to interact with a REST API.
  - **Reactive Forms:** Employs reactive forms for robust and scalable user input handling.
  - **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with a modular and maintainable component structure.

-----

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
  - [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
  - A running instance of the corresponding [REST API](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23rest-api) for the backend.

-----

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure the API endpoint:**
    Open `src/environments/environment.ts` and update the `apiUrl` to point to your backend server.

    ```typescript
    export const environment = {
      apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/tasks' // Or your API endpoint
    };
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```sh
    ng serve
    ```

    Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Functionality

### View Tasks

On the main screen, you will see a list of all your current tasks.

-----

## Technologies Used

  - **Angular:** The core framework for building the application.
  - **Angular Material:**  UI component library that follows the principles of Material Design.
  - **TypeScript:** The primary language used for development.
  - **HTML & CSS:** For structuring and styling the user interface.
  - **Angular CLI:** For project generation and management.

-----

## REST API Integration

This application is designed to work with a RESTful API that supports the following endpoints for task management:

| Operation | HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Read** | `GET` | `/tasks` | Retrieves all tasks. |
| **Create** | `POST` | `/tasks` | Adds a new task. |
| **Update** | `PUT` | `/tasks/:id` | Updates an existing task. |
| **Delete** | `DELETE` | `/tasks/:id` | Deletes a specific task. |

Ensure your backend server is running and accessible from the Angular application. You will need to implement a backend that provides these endpoints.
